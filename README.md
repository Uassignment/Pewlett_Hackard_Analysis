# Summary:
The company should prepare for the “silver tsunami” of the large number of retirees by strengthening its mentorship program. The eligibility of mentorship compared to the number of positions that will be filled with new employees are very small. Planning for robust training, onboarding, continued employee support system will help the company in the long run.
